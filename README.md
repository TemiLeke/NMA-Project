# Trial History Effects on trial-to-trial variability of neural and behavioural data


It has been observed that even under the same stimulus and statistical conditions, neuronal activity and behavioural response can vary significantly from trial-to-trial. We then examined variability in neural activity and behavioral response to find out if this variability is part of the neural code; does the brain employ this feature somhow to optimize information transfer or is this just noise? 

We attempted to solve this by taking into account trial history effects.
